## Intention

The intention of this package and demo is to provide instructions on how to quickly start using Synapticon Devices with ROS2 using Synapticon library.

Additionally, in order to make it compatible with other Linux distributions, we provide Docker file and script for automatic interface recognition and quick set-up of the package inside the container.

## Overview

### Hardware 

The provided package assumes that the laptop on which the setup is used has only one Ethernet port and that only one device is connected at the time. Connection of the external encoders (if internal ones are not used) is labeled with cyan color. Hardware can be used once the parameters are configured with [OBLAC tools](https://www.synapticon.com/en/products/oblac-drives). Detailed instructions and wiring diagrams for all the devices are available at our [official web page](https://www.synapticon.com/en/support/dokumentation) documentation. The simplified block diagram of the wiring used in this setup is given below:

### Software

In this demo, we consider two scenarios:
- Ubuntu 22.04 is installed on the system and ROS Humble and Synapticon package will be installed on that system
- User wants to run the package in isolated environment (possibly because a different distribution of Linux is installed)


	#### Ubuntu 22.04 with ROS2

	To install ROS2 on your Ubuntu machine, follow the steps from the [official website](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debs.html) and install the full version. After the installation, some configuration steps as described [here](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-CLI-Tools/Configuring-ROS2-Environment.html) are needed. For the completeness of the demo, the following commands are copy-paste from the official website and should be executed for the ROS2 installation:

		##### ROS2 Installation

		To make sure that locale supports UTF-8, run the following commands:
		```bash
		sudo apt update && sudo apt install locales
		sudo locale-gen en_US en_US.UTF-8
		sudo update-locale LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 LANG=en_US.UTF-8
		export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
		```
		Enable Ubuntu Universe repository:
		```bash
		sudo apt install software-properties-common
		sudo add-apt-repository universe
		```
		Add GPG key:
		```bash
		sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl -y
		sudo curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key -o /usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg
		```
		Add repository to the sources:
		```bash
		echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release && echo $UBUNTU_CODENAME) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2.list > /dev/null
		```
		Update apt cache:
		```bash
		sudo apt update
		```
		This command is for updating the packages on your system and if the commands after it will work, we recommend skipping it:
		```bash
		sudo apt upgrade
		```
		Finally, install ROS and compilers:
		```bash
		sudo apt install ros-humble-desktop
		sudo apt install ros-dev-tools
		```
		After the installation is complete, add the following line to the end of `/home/USER/.bashrc` file:
		```bash
		source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
		```
		In order for ROS2 not to interfere with communication on other ports, we need to set Domain ID (detailed information is available [here](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Concepts/Intermediate/About-Domain-ID.html)). In our case, we just used 1. To do so, add the following at the end of `/home/YOUR_USER/.bashrc`
		```bash
		export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=1
		```
		After this, restart all your terminals for the source command to be active.
		To verify the installation, open two terminals and run:
		```bash
		ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker
		ros2 run demo_nodes_py listener
		```
		If the nodes are communicating, the installation was successful.

		##### Synapticon Package Installation

		Create a ROS2 workspace:
		```bash
		mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src
		cd ~/ros2_ws/src
		```
		Clone the Synapticon package:
		```bash
		git clone https://github.com/synapticon/synapticon_ros2_control
		```
		After cloning it, you need to set up the ethernet interface. To do so, first execute ifconfig and remember the interface name.

		After that, replace the “eno0”  with your ethernet interface in `/home/USER/ros2_ws/src/synapticon_ros2_control/src/torque_control_executable.cpp` and `/home/USER/ros2_ws/src/synapticon_ros2_control/description/ros2_control/single_dof.ros2_control.xacro`. 
		Alternatively, you can do it with commands:
		```bash
		sed -i "s/eno0/YOUR_ETHERNET_INTERFACE/g" /home/USER/ros2_ws/src/synapticon_ros2_control/src/torque_control_executable.cpp 
		sed -i "s/eno0/YOUR_ETHERNET_INTERFACE/g" /home/USER/ros2_ws/src/synapticon_ros2_control/description/ros2_control/single_dof.ros2_control.xacro
		```
		Install build tools:
		```bash
		sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions
		```
		Build the package:
		```bash
		cd ~/ros2_ws
		rosdep install --from-paths src -y --ignore-src
		colcon build
		```
		Additionally, you can source the workspace by adding the following line to the `/home/USER/.bashrc` file, but above the line where you sourced the ROS installation (above this line: `source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash`):
		```bash
		source /home/USER/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
		```
		To check if the master could be run and if the slaves are found, in the container terminal execute:
		```bash
		./home/YOUR_USER/ros2_ws/install/synapticon_ros2_control/bin/torque_control_executable
		```
		Before running other scripts, stop this one by CTRL+C (or wait, it will shutdown automatically after a while).

		##### Demo
		For turning the motor in different modes, you will need 5 terminals and in all of them execute:
		```bash
		sudo -i
		source /home/application/.bashrc
		```
		- Terminal 1:
		```bash
		ros2 launch synapticon_ros2_control elevated_permissions.launch.py
		```
		- Terminal 2: 
		```bash
		ros2 launch synapticon_ros2_control single_dof.launch.py
		```
		- Terminal 3 - to show the running controllers 
		```bash
		ros2 control list_controllers
		```
		(Information does not automatically refresh - it can be refreshed each M seconds 
		using `watch -n M ros2 control list_controllers`, but the output might be ugly)

		- Running the motor with different controllers:
		
			CSV (Cyclic Sync Velocity) mode:
			
			Terminal 4 to turn on the controller :
			```bash
			ros2 service call /controller_manager/switch_controller controller_manager_msgs/srv/SwitchController "{activate_controllers: ['forward_velocity_controller'], deactivate_controllers: []}"
			```
			Terminal 5 to create a publisher:
			```bash
			ros2 topic pub /forward_velocity_controller/commands std_msgs/msg/Float64MultiArray data:\ [100]
			```
			Stopping it: CTRL+C on Terminal 5 and in Terminal 4:
			```bash
			ros2 service call /controller_manager/switch_controller controller_manager_msgs/srv/SwitchController "{activate_controllers: ['quick_stop_controller'], deactivate_controllers: ['forward_velocity_controller']}"
			```
			- CSP (Cyclic Sync Position) mode:
			
			Terminal 4 to turn on the controller :	
			```bash
			ros2 service call /controller_manager/switch_controller controller_manager_msgs/srv/SwitchController "{activate_controllers: ['forward_position_controller'], deactivate_controllers: [quick_stop_controller]}"
			```
			Terminal 5 to create a publisher:
			```bash
			ros2 topic pub /forward_position_controller/commands std_msgs/msg/Float64MultiArray data:\ [140]
			```
			Stopping it: CTRL+C on Terminal 5 and in Terminal 4:
			```bash
			ros2 service call /controller_manager/switch_controller controller_manager_msgs/srv/SwitchController "{activate_controllers: ['quick_stop_controller'], deactivate_controllers: ['forward_position_controller']}"
			```
				
			- CST (Cyclic Sync Torque) mode:

			Terminal 4 to turn on the controller :
			```bash
			ros2 service call /controller_manager/switch_controller controller_manager_msgs/srv/SwitchController "{activate_controllers: ['forward_torque_controller'], deactivate_controllers: [quick_stop_controller]}"	
			```
			Terminal 5 to create a publisher (value is in permil of torque):
			```bash
			ros2 topic pub /forward_torque_controller/commands std_msgs/msg/Float64MultiArray data:\ [100]	
			```
			Stopping it: CTRL+C on Terminal 5 and in Terminal 4:
			```bash
			ros2 service call /controller_manager/switch_controller controller_manager_msgs/srv/SwitchController "{activate_controllers: ['quick_stop_controller'], deactivate_controllers: ['forward_torque_controller']}"
			```
		##### Running Without Sudo (Optional)

		If you want to run the example without using “sudo”, you need to create:
		```bash
		sudo touch /etc/systemd/system/ros2_control_node.service
		```
		and use text editor to paste in that file the following:

		```bash
		[Unit]
		Description=Launch ros2_control_node with socket permissions

		[Service]
		Type=simple
		User=YOUR_USER
		ExecStartPre=/bin/bash -c 'source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash; source /home/YOUR_USER/.bashrc; source /home/YOUR_USER/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash'
		# Write the user environment to file, for debugging
		#ExecStartPre=/bin/bash -c 'env > /home/YOUR_USER/Documents/ros_env_before_start.txt'

		# This is essentially a copy of my normal user env
		Environment="AMENT_PREFIX_PATH=/home/YOUR_USER/ros2_ws/install/synapticon_ros2_control:/opt/ros/humble"
		Environment="HOME=/home/YOUR_USER"
		Environment="LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/ros/humble/opt/rviz_ogre_vendor/lib:/opt/ros/humble/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu:/opt/ros/humble/lib"
		Environment="PATH=/opt/ros/humble/bin:/usr/lib/ccache:/home/your_user/.local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin:/snap/bin"
		Environment="PYTHONPATH=/opt/ros/humble/lib/python3.10/site-packages:/opt/ros/humble/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages"
		Environment="ROS_DISTRO=humble"
		Environment="ROS_DOMAIN_ID=1"
		Environment="ROS_PYTHON_VERSION=3"
		Environment="ROS_VERSION=2"
		Environment="ROSCONSOLE_FORMAT=[${severity}] - ${node}: [${time}] ${message}"
		Environment="USER=YOUR_USER"
		Environment="USERNAME=YOUR_USER"

		ExecStart=/opt/ros/humble/bin/ros2 launch synapticon_ros2_control elevated_permissions.launch.py
		AmbientCapabilities=CAP_NET_RAW

		[Install]
		WantedBy=multi-user.target
		```
		After pasting, do not forget to replace YOUR_USER with your username and. Save the file, restart the daemon:
		```bash
		sudo systemctl daemon-reload
		```
		and start the service:
		```bash
		sudo systemctl restart ros2_control_node.service
		```
		If you want to check the service status and see the ROS console logging:
		```bash
		sudo systemctl status ros2_control_node.service
		```
		Now, the example can be run by these two commands:
		```bash
		sudo systemctl restart ros2_control_node.service
		ros2 launch synapticon_ros2_control single_dof.launch.py
		```
		Changing the controllers and publishing the desired position/velocity/torque can be now executed without sudo.
		To stop the `ros2_control_node`:
		```bash
		sudo systemctl stop ros2_control_node.service
		```

	#### Isolated Environment (Docker)

	For users with different Linux distributions or those preferring isolation, Docker can be used. Installation steps can be found in the [Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/). For the completeness of the documentation, we provide those steps here also:

		##### Docker Installation

		Install Docker and add the user to the Docker group:
		```bash
		sudo apt update
		sudo apt install -y docker.io
		sudo groupadd docker
		sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
		```
		##### Synapticon Package Installation
		Copy the `Dockerfile` and `synapticon_ros2_controller_build.sh` script from the `ros2_humble_docker` to the same folder on your machine. With the following command, you will run the bash script that will automatically install the ROS2 and package into Docker image, detect the hardware and replace the ethernet adapter name in the necessary files. In case that the script does not detect your hardware properly, you will need to follow the instructions from its output to build Docker image. In the folder where you placed two aforementioned files run:
		```bash
		bash ./synapticon_ros2_controller_build.sh
		```
		To allow Docker containers to output the screen on your system (this is required for RViZ), execute this on the host system:
		```bash
		xhost +
		```
		For the first execution of the program, we build container named `ros2_container` from the image `ros2_humble_synapticon` that we generated by bash script from the Dockerfile using the following command (this command is executed only once):
		```bash
		docker run -it -v /var/run/dbus/system_bus_socket:/var/run/dbus/system_bus_socket -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix --ipc=host -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY  --network=host --env QT_X11_NO_MITSHM=1 --privileged --name ros2_container ros2_humble_synapticon
		```
		Now we have our container running. Each other time, we start container using: 
		```bash
		docker start ros2_container
		```
		For opening a new terminal in the running container, use:
		```bash
		docker exec -it ros2_container bash
		```
		and, once it opens, source ROS2 environment using
		```bash
		source /root/.bashrc
		```
		To check if the master could be run and if the slaves are found, in the container terminal execute:
		```bash
		./install/synapticon_ros2_control/bin/torque_control_executable
		```
		Before running other scripts, stop this one by CTRL+C (or wait, it will shutdown automatically after a while).

		##### Demo

		Connect Synapticon device configured with OBLAC Tools to your ethernet port as shown in Figure 1. For the demo, run 5 terminals in the container (`docker exec -it ros2_container bash` and `source /root/.bashrc`)

		- Terminal 1
		```bash
		ros2 launch synapticon_ros2_control elevated_permissions.launch.py
		```
		- Terminal 2 - this one will open RViZ (if it fails, you forgot to execute "xhost +" on your host machine). If you spin the motor by hand, you should see the movement in RViZ.
		```bash
		ros2 launch synapticon_ros2_control single_dof.launch.py
		```
		- Terminal 3 - to show the running controllers 
		```bash
		ros2 control list_controllers
		```
		(Information does not automatically refresh - it can be refreshed each M seconds 
		using `watch -n M ros2 control list_controllers`, but the output might be ugly)

		- Running the motor with different controllers:

			CSV (Cyclic Sync Velocity) mode:

			Terminal 4 to turn on the controller :
			```bash
			ros2 service call /controller_manager/switch_controller controller_manager_msgs/srv/SwitchController "{activate_controllers: ['forward_velocity_controller'], deactivate_controllers: []}"
			```
			Terminal 5 to create a publisher:
			```bash
			ros2 topic pub /forward_velocity_controller/commands std_msgs/msg/Float64MultiArray data:\ [100]
			```
			Stopping it: CTRL+C on Terminal 5 and in Terminal 4:
			```bash
			ros2 service call /controller_manager/switch_controller controller_manager_msgs/srv/SwitchController "{activate_controllers: ['quick_stop_controller'], deactivate_controllers: ['forward_velocity_controller']}"
			```
			- CSP (Cyclic Sync Position) mode:
			Terminal 4 to turn on the controller :	
			```bash
			ros2 service call /controller_manager/switch_controller controller_manager_msgs/srv/SwitchController "{activate_controllers: ['forward_position_controller'], deactivate_controllers: [quick_stop_controller]}"
			```
			Terminal 5 to create a publisher:
			```bash
			ros2 topic pub /forward_position_controller/commands std_msgs/msg/Float64MultiArray data:\ [140]
			```
			Stopping it: CTRL+C on Terminal 5 and in Terminal 4:
			```bash
			ros2 service call /controller_manager/switch_controller controller_manager_msgs/srv/SwitchController "{activate_controllers: ['quick_stop_controller'], deactivate_controllers: ['forward_position_controller']}"
			```
				
			- CST (Cyclic Sync Torque) mode:

			Terminal 4 to turn on the controller :
			```bash
			ros2 service call /controller_manager/switch_controller controller_manager_msgs/srv/SwitchController "{activate_controllers: ['forward_torque_controller'], deactivate_controllers: [quick_stop_controller]}"	
			```
			Terminal 5 to create a publisher (value is in per mille of torque):
			```bash
			ros2 topic pub /forward_torque_controller/commands std_msgs/msg/Float64MultiArray data:\ [100]	
			```
			Stopping it: CTRL+C on Terminal 5 and in Terminal 4:
			```bash
			ros2 service call /controller_manager/switch_controller controller_manager_msgs/srv/SwitchController "{activate_controllers: ['quick_stop_controller'], deactivate_controllers: ['forward_torque_controller']}"
			```
